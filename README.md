- The number of doors and number of doors to pre-disclose can be left off & the default will be used. If only one is left off, the remaining one is assumed to be the number of doors.
- In addition to the input help given for an incorrect input, the user can also input "MontyHall.exe Help" for more detailed help. The automatic help instead describes one specific problem.
- To distinguish between strategies, the user must type "Switch" or "Stay", case sensitive.

- Learn about containers, including std::array, std::vector, gsl::span
- Learn about random number generators in C++11

Project Name(s): MontyHall

Create a simulation of the game show "Let's Make a Deal."

Take as input though the command line the following information:

- Number of doors. (default==3)
- Number of doors to pre-disclose. (default==1)
- Number of game instances.
- Switch or Stay strategy.

Create a class named "LetsMakeADeal" that represents a game instance. 

Store your game instances in a container obtained from a library. 

Output the probability of success as a single number in floating point format [0.0, 1.0]

After the simulations are run, total the probablity.

Display the probabilty of obtaining the Car.

Create an assert statement to ensure the probability of a Goat vs a Car is 1.0. 

Provide command line help in the event the command line is incomplete. Be concise and helpful.
